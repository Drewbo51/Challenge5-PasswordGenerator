# Challenge5-PasswordGenerator
1. Struggled alot with finding a method to generate a random character from user selected character types. Eventually used a for loop
and plugged the generated variable 'm' which worked.
2. Only issue I have is that I couldn't find a method to delete the generated password before generating a new one.
